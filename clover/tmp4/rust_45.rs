fn heron_triangle_area(a: i32, b: i32, c: i32) -> f64 {
    if a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a {
        return -1.0;
    }

    let s = (a + b + c) as f64 / 2.0;
    let area = (s * (s - a as f64) * (s - b as f64) * (s - c as f64)).sqrt();
    
    (area * 100.0).round() / 100.0
}

fn main() {
    // Example usage:
    let area = heron_triangle_area(3, 4, 5); // Should return a valid triangle area.
    println!("The area of the triangle is {}", area);
}
```

Note: The provided function signature `fn triangle_area(a: i32, h: i32)` cannot be used to calculate the area of a triangle given three side lengths, as it seems to refer to using a base `a` and a height `h`. Above, I have provided a correct function signature and implementation using Heron's formula, which calculates the area of a triangle when given the lengths of all three sid
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_triangle_area() {
        assert!(triangle_area(5, 3) == 7.5);
        assert!(triangle_area(2, 2) == 2.0);
        assert!(triangle_area(10, 8) == 40.0);
    }

}
