 the Rust program that implements the functionality described in the docstring:

```rust
fn fizz_buzz(n: i32) -> i32 {
    let mut count = 0;
    for i in 0..n {
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0 {
            count += i.to_string().matches('7').count() as i32;
        }
    }
    count
}

fn main() {
    // Example usage:
    let result = fizz_buzz(100);
    println!("The number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than 100, which are divisible by 11 or 13, is: {}", result);
}
```

This program will count the number of occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13, and output the cou
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;


    #[test]
    fn test_fizz_buzz() {
        assert!(fizz_buzz(50) == 0);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(78) == 2);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(79) == 3);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(100) == 3);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(200) == 6);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(4000) == 192);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(10000) == 639);
        assert!(fizz_buzz(100000) == 8026);
    }

}
