This method copies elements from array nl into array line at the position at. The length of line and nl before insertion are represented by l and p respectively. It mandates that 0 <= l + p <= line.Length, 0 <= p <= nl.Length, and 0 <= at <= l. The method modifies line such that for all i in 0 <= i < p, line[at + i] equals nl[i], and all previous elements of line maintain their original values.
