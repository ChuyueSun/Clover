Given two array `src` and `dest`, two start index `sStart` and `dStart`, and a length value `len`, returns an array `r`. The `sStart` + `len` is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the length of `src`, and the `dStart` + `len` is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the length of `dest`. The returned `r` should have the same prefix with `dest` for the elements before `dStart`. Ensure r and dest have the same length.
