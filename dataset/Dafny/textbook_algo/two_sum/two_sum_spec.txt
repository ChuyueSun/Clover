Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the first pair of indices i < j of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 
Require that such pair (i , j) exist in the array. 
Ensure for all i less than returned i and for all j, that no other i, j exists.
Ensure for all j between returned i j, no other j exist.
